[> Intro
--------
In this repository, we experiment creating systems on proFPGA processing systems with LiteX.
proFPGA systems are generic FPGA processing systems exposing the FPGA's IOs on sereval sites
allowing the system to be customized with specific adapters boards.

The initial aim of this project is to demonstrate some LiteX based configurations on proFPGA hardware
and provide an infrastructure to easily modify/extend them using LiteX's flexibility.
